# IMPROVEMENTS FOR PV Curve Tracer

This is a list of changes we can make to the board in future versions to improve
it in various ways. Some of these are functional, others are purely aesthetic.

1. Built in RTD sensor.
2. Secondary UART communication line.
3. Shrink board to sub 100x100mm.
4. Use TM4C for more peripherals?
